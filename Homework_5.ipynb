Build these from two sine waves and noise, similar to what we did in class, HOWEVER instead of adding the two sine waves together you will MULTIPLY them, each weighted the same (and then add noise). This will create an oscillating signal of the shorter wavelength sine with an overlaid oscillating \"envelope\" from the larger wavelength sine. <br/>\n",
